This PHP code is designed to handle form submissions from a webpage. It receives data from a POST request, processes it, and then sends an email notification based on the provided information. Below is a breakdown of how the code works:

Receiving Data: The code starts by extracting data from the POST request. The $_POST superglobal is used to retrieve values from the submitted form fields. The code assumes that the form fields on the webpage are named 'name', 'email', 'subject', and 'message', as indicated by $_POST['name'], $_POST['email'], etc.

Assigning Data: The extracted data (name, email, subject, and message) is assigned to corresponding variables: $name, $email, $subject, and $message.

Setting Recipient: The email will be sent to the address specified in the $to variable. In this case, it's set to "thajasathees12@gmail.com". You would need to replace this email address with the actual recipient's email address.

Setting Headers: The 'From' header for the email is set to the value of the $email variable. This will indicate in the email who the sender is, based on the provided email in the form.

Sending Email: The code uses the mail() function to send an email. It takes four arguments: the recipient email address ($to), the email subject ($subject), the email message ($message), and the headers ($headers). If the mail() function successfully sends the email, it returns true, and the code responds with a JSON-encoded success message. If the email sending fails, the code responds with a JSON-encoded error message.

Response Codes: The code sets the HTTP response code to 200 (OK) regardless of whether the email was successfully sent or not. This might not be the best practice; generally, a different response code would be set for successful and unsuccessful operations. For example, a 200 code for success and a 500 code for failure.

JSON Response: The response message, whether successful or not, is encoded as JSON. In the success case, it's simply a string indicating the message was sent successfully. In the error case, it's an array with a 'msg' key containing an error message.
